This folder contains the source code for the firmware running on the ATmega328p microcontroller in the folder `Computational_Firmware`.

Code for the ATmega328p half of the Computational Datalogger is in the folder `Computational_Firmware`. It was developed using Arduino IDE version 1.8.9, though there are very few actual Arduino Libraries used (in order to save on performance).
