# WM-Node Hardware

This directory contains design files pertaining to the WM-Node datalogging device separated into two directories.

## PCB Design
The directory PCB_Design contains design files in KiCad for a printed circuit board which hosts all of the required components to transform a Raspberry Pi into a WM-Node device. The design files are generated using KiCad 5, and manufacturing files will soon be available as well.

## Off-the-shelf Parts
There will soon be a directory containing diagrams and instructions for creating a WM-Node using a Raspberry Pi and off-the-shelf parts.
