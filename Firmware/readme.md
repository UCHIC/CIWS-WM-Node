This folder will contain code for both the ATmega328p and the Raspberry Pi.

Code for the ATmega328p half of the Computational Datalogger is in the folder Computational_Firmware. It was developed using Arduino IDE version 1.8.9, though there are very few actual Arduino Libraries used (in order to save on performance).

This code is still under development.
