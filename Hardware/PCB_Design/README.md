This folder contains all the files necessary for manufacturing PCBs.

The `.pro` and `.sch` files are the board layout and schematic respectively. Use these two files with the `.kicad_pcb` file to view the design in kicad.

The `.csv` file and `.zip` files are used for manufaturing the devices. The `.zip` file contains the drill file, gerber files, assembly drawings, and position files. The `.csv` is a list of components used on the device.
